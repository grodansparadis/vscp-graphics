# Remote Variables 

Remote variables is a very powerful feature of the VSCP Daemon. At first they are often neglected as something exotic but if looking at them a bit closer one soon find that they are actually a very useful tool. Variables is just persistent typed objects that can be reached and/or read/updated from remote interfaces or updated when things happen in the system. A typical variable can be the state of a physical thing out in the world. The “thing” updates it's status from time to time and then also updates the variable. One can therefore just read the variable to know the last state of the "thing". Valuable when a software start from being down so it can get an initial state or for keeping track of the state of "things" that is not always connected.

A variable may also for example hold the energy consumption over a month of a year. When energy consumption events comes in to the system they are just added to this variable. In short variables can be viewed as a sort of database but with discrete values.

In the decision matrix you can


*  Store a value to a variable

*  Add a value to a variable

*  Subtract a value from a variable

*  Multiply a value to a variable.

*  Divide a value with a variable.

*  Make decisions based on variable values.

*  Read/Write variables in LUA scripts.

The first time variable is used it is constructed. So if you for example add a value to a variable that does not exist it will first be created. For add/subtract/multiply/divide variables that does not exist will be created as a floating point value. The store variable on the other hand let you select the type.


Note that there is possible to create dynamically created variables by using the [available escapes](vscp_daemon_decision_matrix#variable_substitution_for_parameters). As an example a variable **energy_usage_%monthtxtfull_%year** can be created that will have names like "//energy_usage_october_2014//", *energy_usage_november_2014*". So if you create a decision matrix entry that trigger on the **CLASS1.MEASUREMENT, Type=13, Energy** and where the action adds the measurement to the variable  **energy_usage_%monthtxtfull_%year** you will get the energy usage for each month of a year in it's own clearly named variable. Variables that can be fetched and presented to a user in a diagram for example.

## Variable types

Action that store variables and variables that are written in the the [TCP/IP interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_tcp_ip_protocol_description#variable) and in the [websocket interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_websocket_protocol_description) have a string format. This format is described in the table below

**Note** Types with **base64**=//yes// will be read (and should be set) as base64 encoded values.

The second boolean parameter of the string form is persistent (true) or non persistent (false). A persistent variable is saved on disk, a non persistent variable is only kept in memory and will be lost on a restart of the software.

You can use either the numerical type (**"1"** for the string type for example) or the type token (**"STRING"** for the string type for example). So a string can be defined either as 
    STRING;true;c29tZSBraW5kIG9mIHN0cmluZw==
or as 
    1;true;c29tZSBraW5kIG9mIHN0cmluZw==
where 
    c29tZSBraW5kIG9mIHN0cmluZw==
is the string content
    “some kind of string”
    

**Notes**

*  GUID is always on the form "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF" or "-" where the dash means "use the interface GUID".

*  Data of an event will always be a comma separated list of data with variable length where the length depends on how many data bytes the event actually have.

*  Complete list of MIME codes is [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/mime-types-complete-list/).

## Reset variable values

To reset a variable may seem a strange thing to do. But it is just setting it's value to a known default value. The reset variable command available in the [TCP/IP interface]() and the [websocket interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_vscp_websocket_interface) set variables to the following values. 

 | Variable            | type | Reset value                                                           |

## XML storage format

The main storage for persistent variables from version 1.12.10 is in a database. But variables can still be loaded/save from/to XML files. One typical use can be to load initialised non-persistent variables into memory on start up. Loaded persistent variables will be written to persistent storage and if already available in the database there value will be updated with the XML version. 

`<code=xml>`
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`

`<variables>` `<!-- <persistent>` is an older form --> 

    `<!-- Modern format -->`
    <variable name="variable name"
              type="numerical type|textual type" 
              persistent="true|false"  
              user="user who owns the variable" 
              access-rights="accessrights for variable" 
              value="variable value, some value types should be base64 encoded."
              note="note about variable"  
              note-base64="base64 encoded note (saved in this form)" >
    `</variable>`

    `<!-- Legacy format  -->` 
    `<variable type="string" user="12" access-rights="777" >`                  
        `<name>`testvariable_string`</name>`         
        `<value>`String value`</value>`
        `<note>`note about variable`</note>`    
    `</variable>`

`</variables>`

## Non-persistent variables

Non persistent variables is stored in RAM and will disappear when the VSCP daemon is restarted. They are therefore mostly used for session data and similar things.

## Persistent variables

Persistent variables is stored in a persistent way. They will survive VSCP Daemon restarts.

## Read only variables

Read only variables can only be read not changed. The typical use is for most stock variables generated by the daemon itself. 

## Access rights for variables

Access rights are given in the Unix format uuugggooo, where uuu is owner rights, gggg is group rights (currently no use) and ooo rights for other. Each part then is rwx for read, write and execute. So 7 is the same as all rights allowed and 0 none. Or 777 to allow everyone to do anything. A zero makes it possible only for the admin user to do things with the variable. Execute have meaning for LUA and Javascript execution.

## Stock variables

Stock variables is variables that are generated dynamically by the VSCP daemon. They are therefore always non-persistent in there nature but is always available if the feature they belong to is enabled. 

In the stock variables you can get information about most configuration variables of the VSCP daemon and also about dynamic things that happen inside the system such as when the last heartbeat event was sent.

Here is a list of defined stock variables.

## Other way to interact with variables

You are not limited to handle variables in the [decision matrix](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_decision_matrix).  You can write/read/create variables in the [tcp/ip interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_tcp_ip_control_interface). As the [VSCP helper library](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscphelper/doku.php?id=non_graphic_lib_api#variable_handling) includes functionality to write/read/create variables you can actually handle them from any program language available. But variables can also written/read/created in the [webserver](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php) admin interface, in the [websocket interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_vscp_websocket_interface) and in the [REST interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_vscp_daemon_rest_interface).

Variables is a powerful tool that makes your work easier.

# CAN4VSCP Level I Driver

**Available for:** Windows, Linux

**Driver for Windows** vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.dll (install-dir/drivers) \\ 
**Driver for Linux** vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.so (/usr/local/lib/vscpl1_can4vscpdrv.so) When using the drive on Linux remember to set rw permissions for the user that the VSCP daemon and VSCP works run under (//chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0// for example).

This is a driver for the low cost **Frankfurt RS-232 module** that us the [VSCP serial protocol](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=physical_level_lower_level_protocols#vscp_over_a_serial_channel_rs-232). The Frankfurt RS-232 module is described [here](http://www.grodansparadis.com/can4vscp_rs232/can4vscp_rs232.html) where there also is a description of how to use it with VSCP Works and the VSCP daemon.  The Frankfurt RS-232 can be bought from the [Frogshop](http://www.frogshop.se).

As the VSCP serial protocol is very generic this may also be the driver to use for your own hardware that have a serial port available.

## Parameter String

### Windows

    port[;nBaud]

##### port

The first parameter is the serial port to use (COM1, COM2 and so on). 



### Linux

    device[;nBaud]

##### device

The first parameter is the device to use (// /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 or /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc // ) etc. 

##### nBaud

This is an optional baudrate code. If not given the dafault 115200 will be used. The following settings are available

 | Baudrate | Code | Error  | Windows | Linux | 
 | -------- | ---- | -----  | ------- | ----- | 
 | 115200   | 0    | -1.36% | yes     | yes   |

 | 57600    | 12   | 0.94%  | yes     | yes   | 

Tests on Windows and Linux has been done on a Windows 10 machine and on a Ubuntu machine with the USB serial adapter that ship with Frankfurt RS-232.

## Flags

 | Bits     | Usage                                                                                                                                                   | 
 | ----     | -----                                                                                                                                                   | 
 | Bit 0,1  | **Open Mode**\\ \\ **0** - normal\\ **1** - Listen mode\\ **2** - Loopback mode\\ **3** - Reserved\\ \\                                                 | 
 | Bit 2    | If set the driver will not switch to VSCP mode. That is it must be in VSCP mode. Open will be faster.                                                   | 
 | Bit 3    | If set the driver will wait for an ACK from the physical device for every sent frame. This will slow down sending but make transmission it very secure. | 
 | Bit 4    | Enable timestamp. The timestamp will be written by the hardware instead of the driver.                                                                  | 
 | Bit 5    | Enable hardware handshake.                                                                                                                              | 
 | Bit 6-31 | Reserved                                                                                                                                                | 
## Status return

The CanalGetStatus call returns the status structure with the channel_status member having the following meaning:

 | Bit      | Description                      | 
 | ---      | -----------                      | 
 | Bit 0-7  | TX Error Counter.                | 
 | Bit 8-15 | RX Error Counter.                | 
 | Bit 16   | Overflow. Cleard by status read. | 
 | Bit 17   | RX Warning.                      | 
 | Bit 18   | TX Warning.                      | 
 | Bit 19   | TX bus passive.                  | 
 | Bit 20   | RX bus passive.                  | 
 | Bit 21   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 22   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 23   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 24   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 25   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 26   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 27   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 28   | Reserved.                        | 
 | Bit 29   | Bus Passive.                     | 
 | Bit 30   | Bus Warning status.              | 
 | Bit 31   | Bus off status.                  | 

## Serial Protocol

You can find the description of the VSCP serial protocol in the [VSCP specification](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=physical_level_lower_level_protocols#vscp_over_a_serial_channel_rs-232).

# TCP/IP Protocol Description

## Port

Default Port is 9598 but the interface can be available on several port and several interfaces on a specific hardware.

## Command and response format

The VSCP TCP protocol is very much like the POP3 protocol.


*  A command is sent (ending with CRLF)

*  A response line is received starting with either ”**+OK**” for success or ”**-OK**” for failure. The initial “token” is followed by some descriptive text that is separated from the initial token with “ - “ (a dash with a space on it's both sides).

For some commands there can be data in between the two lines. For instance the “**VERS**” command looks like this

    send: 'VERS`<CR>``<LF>` 
    received line 1: '1,0,0`<CR>``<LF>` 
    received line 2: '+OK - `<CR>``<LF>`

## Link interfaces

The daemon interface can be visible also on lower end (typically TC/IP) nodes. A subset of the commands are required to be available on such a node. Commands marked with yes in the link column below are the ones that a link node must have. All others are not mandatory on this type of nodes.

## NOOP - No operation

 This operation does nothing. It just replies with ”**+OK**”.

##  QUIT - Close the connection

Close the connection to the host. 


##  HELP - Give help

'HELP' alone givs help about all commands. 'HELP command" gives command specific help.

## USER - Username for login.

Used to enter username for a password protected server.

Used on the following form:

USER username`<CR>``<LF>`

## PASS - Password for login

Used to enter username for a password protected server.

Used on the following form:

PASS password`<cr>``<lf>`

## CHALLENGE - Get challenge session id

Used to get a session unique id

Used on the following form:

    CHALLENGE password`<cr>``<lf>`

and give a response such as

    +OK - e14712fa9d6a62ff388a701848e24a32

where "e14712fa9d6a62ff388a701848e24a32" is the 32 byte sid.

## RESTART

Restart the daemon. Must have highest privilege to be able to do this. 

##  SHUTDOWN

shutdown the daemon. Must have highest privilege to be able to do this. 

## SEND - Send an event.

Used on the following form:

    send head,class,type,obid,datetime,timestamp,GUID,data1,data2,data3....
or
    send $variablename  
    

**Important note** datetime is introduced in version *1.12.20.0*

The GUID is given on the form MSB-byte:MSB-byte-1:MSB-byte-2……. The GUID can also be given as ”-” in which case the GUID of the interface is used for the event. This GUID is constructed from the Ethernet MAC address and some other parameters to be globally unique.

**datetime** is UTC date time (Coordinated Universal Time) on ISO format 
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:DD
Can be empty left empty and in that case the current UTC date/time is set by the system.

If timestamp is a relative time in microseconds. It can be empty in which case a timestamp will be set by the system. Before version *1.12.20.0* a timestamp of zero would be replaced by a system set timestamp this is not the case anymore. 

Note: obid is just a place holder here to have a similar line as the receive command and is used internally by the daemon as an interface index. The value you use will always be overwritten by the daemon. head is currently not used.

CLASS=512 - CLASS=1023 is treated in a special way by the daemon. If you use the interface GUID as the first sixteen data bytes the event will only be set through that interface. This is the correct way to send a Level I event through the daemon. You can send Level I events without the GUID also but in that case the event will be sent out on all interfaces and as each interface can have nodes with this nickname all will be affected.

The variable send form makes it possible to send the content in a variable that is of type event. In this case give the name of the variable as argument preceded with a dollar ('$') sign.

**head** is defined as 
    bit 7,6,5 priority => Priority 0-7 where 0 is highest.
    bit 4 = hard coded, true for a hard coded device.
    bit 3 = Don't calculate CRC, Set to zero to use CRC.
    bit 2 = Undefined.
    bit 1 = Undefined.
    bit 0 = Undefined.

**Example:**
Send a full GUID event

    send 0,20,3,,,,0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15,0,1,35`<CR>``<LF>`

Send Event. The example is the same as above but the GUID of the interface will be used.

    send 0,20,3,,,,-,0,1,35`<CR>``<LF>` 
    
Send event with UTC time set

    send 0,20,3,,2001-11-02T18:00:01,,-,0,1,35`<CR>``<LF>`  

Both send the [CLASS1.INFORMATION TYPE=3 ON event](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.information#type_3_0x03_on), for zone=1, sub-zone=35

**Send event to specific interface**
It is possible to send Level I events to a specific interface. To do this use the Level II mirror Level I events ( Class=512-1023 VSCP Level II Level I events - CLASS2.LEVELI). This is events with class equal to 512 - 1023 which mirrors the Level I events but have the destination GUID in data bytes 0-15. Thees data-bytes is set to the interface (14 upper bits) and the node-ID for the node one wants to communicate with is in GUID[0]. This event will be sent to the correct interface.

So the above example would be

    send 0,20,3,,,0,-,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,0,0,1,35`<CR>``<LF>`

where class becomes *532* (512 + 20) and where *15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,0,0* is the interface the events should be routed to. Note the two zeros at the two least significant bytes which is always zero for an interface and is used for node id's.


**Send content of variable**

    send $tempevent1
 
In this example the content of the variable tempevent1 is sent. The variable is of type event.  

## RETR - Retrieve one or several event(s).

This command can be used to retrieve one or several events from the input queue. Events are returned as

    head,class,type,obid,datetime,timestamp,GUID,data0,data1,data2,...........

**Important note** datetime was added in version *1.12.20.0*

GUID with MSB first.

Used on the following form:

    RETR 2`<CR>``<LF>` 

which gives

    0,20,3,0,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:0:5:93:140:2:32:0:1 
    0,20,4,0,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:0:5:93:140:2:32:0:1 
    +OK - Success 

If no events is available in the queue

	
	-OK - No event(s) available


is received by the client.

If you try to fetch more events then there are in the queue you will get

    retr 100
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
 1. OK - No event(s) available

You request 100 events but there is only 6 available so you get a negative reply.

VSCP Event originating from a CANAL driver have the nickname of the node in the LSB of the GUID ( GUID[15] ). The rest of the GUID is the GUID for the interface.

If no argument is given one event is fetched even if there are more in the queue. 

If you try to receive more events then there is events in the buffer -OK will be returned after the available number of events have been retrieved and been listed.

## RCVLOOP - Send events to client as soon as they arrive.

This command set the channel in a closed loop that only can be interrupted by a client closing the connection or by sending the CLOSELOOP command. The server will now send out an event as soon as it is reserved. This is done in a very effective way with high throughput. This means the client does not have to poll for new events. It just open one channel where it sends events and do control tasks and one channel where it receive evens.

To help in determining that the line is alive

    +OK

is sent with a two second interval. The format for the event data is the same as for RETR command.

Some applications may not implement this feature and should output

    [-OK - Command not implemented`<CR>``<LF>`]

to indicate this. 

## QUITLOOP - quit receiving loop

### disable

Disable a decision matrix row. Argument is a comma separated list with DM row number(s) or “ALL” for all rows. 

### list

Show a decision matrix row number. Argument is DM row number(s) or “ALL” for all rows. 

The list command gives a list of the following format

*  To: Allowed date plus time up to which the action can be triggered. Form is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

*  Weekdays: Allowed weekdays for the action to be triggered. 

*  Time: The time(s) when the action should be triggered. This is a string on the form YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. where both parts can be replaced with a '*' to indicate that it is a no care. This means that * * is for all dates and all time while * HH:MM:SS is for all dates but a specific times. Further, all elements such as YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS can be replaced with a * to represent a no care for each place where it is present. Each can also be given as a list separated with '/' characters to indicate several choices. So YYYY-MM-DD HH:0/5/10;SS means the action should be performed on a specific date and hour on every full hour (0), five minutes past (5) and ten minutes past (10).

*  **Sub-zone**: Is also part of the filter but is an absolute value from data-byte 2. 

*  **Control-code**: The 32-bit control code. Note that enable/disable is part of this code. 

*  **Action-code**: The action code follows next. 

*  **Action-param**: A string consisting of action parameters. 

*  **Comment**: A comment for the row.

*  **Trig-counter**: This is a counter for how many time the action for the row has been executed. 

*  **Error-counter**: This is a counter for action execution errors for the row.

See the DM description in the VSCP specification for information about the content of the control code etc. 

### add

Se [sub:The-decision-matrix-file-format] for decision matrix file format.

## VAR / VARIABLE

Changed to "VAR" from "VARIABLE" in version 1.12.14.6


### list

List all defined variables selected by an optional [regular expression](https///www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/). Default is that all variables is listed (no argument). 

Use for example

    variable list vscp.
    
to list all stock variables or

    variable list vscp.dm.

to list all stock variables related to the decision matrix.

Output for the command is

a first row with 

    n rows.`<CR>`LF>
    
where "n" is the number of rows that follow (# variables)

and then followed by zero or more

    ordinal;variablename;numeric-variabletype;userid;access-rights;last-change;persistance`<CR>``<LF>`

where ordinal goes from zero and upwards and then a

    +OK`<CR>``<LF>`
    
is returned.      

### write

Write a variable. If the variable is not already defined it is created.  Argument is 

    "variable name";"type";"persistence";"owner";"rights";"value";"note"


*  **name** is the name of the variable.

*  **variable-type** is the variable type in numerical or string form (default is string).  

*  **persistence** can be “true” or “false” (default is "false"). If set to true a persistent variable is created.

*  **owner** is the owner of the variable. Can be given on numerical (userid) or in text form. If not given the current user is used.

*  **access-rights** is the numerical access rights (default is 0x744).

*  **value** is the value for the variable. Note that certain forms of variables always expect the value to be coded in BASE64, for example the string type expects this. [See table](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=decision_matrix_varaibles#variable_types) for info about which variables expect BASE64 encoded value input.

*  **note** is a note for the variable. Always coded in BASE64.

You can have empty items like

    “name of variable”;;;;”value” 

which get default values set for the missing parts. Not entering fields like the field "note" above give the same effect. So to write a variable with all default values one can write

 "name of variable"

this will be a non-persistent string owned by the current user and with permission 744.

Also note that if a variable already exist, access-rights, persistence, value and note will have there values changed for the existing variable. The type of a variable can never be changed if it already exists. In this case remove it first.

### read

Read a variable. Argument is “name of variable”.

The response (if the variable exist) is

    +OK - name;type;user;access-rights;persistence;last-change;value;note

where type and user always is numeric. 

If an error occurs

	
	  -OK - Variable does not exists.


if the variable is non existent.

### readvalue

Read a variables value. The value is BASE64 encoded if internally stored as such (type=string etc). Arguments is “name of variable” The response is

    value`<CR>``<LF>`
    +OK  

or if the variable is not defined

	
	  -OK - Variable is not defined.`<CR>``<LF>`

 

### writevalue

Write a variables value. Arguments is “name of variable” and "value". The response is

    +OK`<CR>``<LF>`  

or if the variable is not defined

	
	  -OK - Variable is not defined.`<CR>``<LF>`


The format for different variable types is [here](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=decision_matrix_varaibles#variable_types). 

### readnote

Read a variables note. The note is always returned BASE64 encoded. Arguments is “name of variable” The response is

    note`<CR>``<LF>`
    +OK  

or if the variable is not defined

	
	  -OK - Variable is not defined.`<CR>``<LF>`

 

### writenote

Write a variables note. Arguments is “name of variable” and "note". The response is

    +OK`<CR>``<LF>`  

or if the variable is not defined

	
	  -OK - Variable is not defined.`<CR>``<LF>`


### reset

Variable  value is set to its default value. The default values for different variables types can be found [here](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=decision_matrix_varaibles#reset_variable_values). Command does not work with stock variables ad they can not be resetted.

### readreset

This is a combination of **read** + **reset** doing them together in an atomic way. Command does not work with stock variables ad they can not be resetted.

### remove

Removes a variable. Argument is name of the variable. Command does not work with stock variables ad they can not be removed.

### readremove

This is a combination of **read** + **remove** doing them together in an atomic way. Command does not work with stock variables ad they can not be removed.

### length

Get the length for a string variable. No effect for other variable types (returns 0 ). 

### save

Save persistent, non-persistent or both variable types to an external XML file. 

Argument is 

   * **path** to where the XML file should be written.
   * **select** Which is "1" for only writing persistent variables, "2" only write non-persistent variables and "3" or "0" for writing both types. Defaults to "0".
   * **regex** Optional regular expression that selects which variables to write. Default is all.

Output format from daemon for variable list/read commands is

[Here is an example](VSCP Daemon variable persistent storage format) of how variables are stored on disk.

### load

Load variables from XML file on disk.

   * **path** to where the XML file to be loaded is located.

This is how the variables look like using the variable list all command in the TCP/IP interface.

## TABLE

The VSCP daemon can handle [three types of tables](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp-tables). 


*  Dynamic tables which is ever growing tables that will grow until all disk space is used or deleted or cleared by a users. Just as any database.

*  Static tables which consist of a limited set of data which is filled in up to s specified size and when that size is reached the number of items in the table will be kept at this level by removing the oldest records.

*  Max tables which is tables that just like static tables have a set size but which collect data up to the set size and then delete all content and start to collect data again.

Both are intended as a way for time stamp ,measurement pairs to be logged in an easy way and then being displayed in diagram form in a user UI. The most convenient way to handle this information from a web base application is through the [REST api](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_vscp_daemon_rest_interface) or the [websocket interface](http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=vscp_daemon_vscp_websocket_interface) but sometime the tcp/ip interface is more convenient to use and it is thus possible to get table data also here.

### create 'table-name' 'create-parameters...'

Create a new table with name 'table-name' using the supplied parameters described below.

The parameters is given as a comma separated list. Some parameters which could have comma or other *invalid characters* in them can be encoded in BASE64 and if so should be preceded with "BASE64:".

### delete 'table-name' [true]

Delete an existing table and optional remove it's associating database file if the last argument is 'true'. Default is to leave the database file. If this is done and a new table with the same name later is created this file will be reused. This can cause troubles if the two tables have different columns defined.

**'del'** can be used instead of **'delete'**

### list

### get 'table-name' 'from' 'to' ["full"]

Get table data from a named table over an optional interval **to - from** which each should be on the form (ISO 8601) YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.

If "full" is specified all fields of the table is listed. **datetime** is always listed first followed by **value** and after that the rest of the fields are listed.

The output will look like this

    'count' rows`<CR>``<LF>`
    YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSsss, value1[,other fields]`<CR>``<LF>`
    YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSsss, value2[,other fields]`<CR>``<LF>`
    YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSsss, value3[,other fields]`<CR>``<LF>`
    ...
    YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, valuen[,other fields]`<CR>``<LF>`
    +OK - Success.`<CR>``<LF>`


### getraw 'table-name' 'from' 'to' 

Get table data from a named table over an optional interval **to - from** which each should be on the form (ISO 8601) YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS. 

The difference between get and getraw is that getraw always outputs all fields of a table as a comma separated list while get treat datetime and value as special values.
### log 'table-name' value [datetime]

log data to a named table.

Table-name and value must be given. Table-name must be a valid and existing table. The value should be a floating point value. A period ('.') is always used as a decimal separator regardless of language settings. The datettime value is on standard ISO date/time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ) and should always be given as UTC time. The "sss" is millisecond part. 

If datetime is not given the current UTC time will be used. 
### logsql 'table-name' 'sql'

Statistical function that return the max of all values over a date range *from to* or over the full table if no range is given. The date time ranges should be given in ISO format YYYYMMDDTHH:MM:SS as usual.

### average 'table-name' [from to]

Statistical function that return the average of all values over a date range *from to* or over the full table if no range is given. The date time ranges should be given in ISO format YYYYMMDDTHH:MM:SS as usual.

### median 'table-name' [from to]

Statistical function that return the median / third quartile of all values over a date range *from to* or over the full table if no range is given. The date time ranges should be given in ISO format YYYYMMDDTHH:MM:SS as usual.

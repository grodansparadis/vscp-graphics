# The 5 second I don't want to read a shit walk through

 1.  Start VSCP daemon
 2.  Start VSCP Works, open a session to the localhost. Se events from simulated driver.
 3.  Open Browser. [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and test websocket samples. Data is from the simulation driver.
 4.  Open browser. [http://localhost:8080/vscp](http://localhost:8080/vscp) check the built in administrative interface.

Read on or uninstall.

# Setting up the system on Windows

Installing VSCP & Friends for windows is done by installing the latest installation package. All packages are available for download at [Sourceforge](https///sourceforge.net/projects/m2m/files/VSCP%20Software/). All you need to do is to download the file and then run it and the system will be installed for you. 

__From VSCP & Friends version 1.0.0 windows 7 or larger version of Windows is a requirement.__

If you want to compile the package yourself [download the source](https///sourceforge.net/projects/m2m/files/VSCP%20Software/) and read the __BUILD_WIN32.txt__ file in the root of the source folder on how to build the system. You find the source in the same folder as the installation packages. The source for the system is also available on [GitHub](https///github.com/grodansparadis/vscp_software) if you want to use unstable code or just prefers GitHub.

The daemon comes in two flavors on windows. Either **vscpservice** which installs as a service on windows and runs in the background or as **vscpd** which is a standard windows application which opens in a window. The first can be useful for a deployed system while the other is good when you are testing a system or developing new drivers or other components.

A sample configuration file for Windows is [here](https///github.com/grodansparadis/vscp_software/blob/master/config_examples/vscpd.conf_windows_distro) and a sample configuration file is installed for you (see files below).

The two programs which are most important is the **VSCP daemon** and **VSCP Works**. You find them under **VSCP & Friends** under the program menu.  There are many other files in the installation folder which you normally find at

    c:\Program Files (x86)\VSCP

Here is a short description of what you find in this folder.

## Taking your newly installed system for a test ride

    
To take a newly installed VSCP & Friends system on a test ride [go to this page](new system install test ride).


## vscpd

The vscpd application is just run from it's place in the menu or from it's install location. A window will open after that and display some debug information according to set log level. Quit the VSCP daemon by closing the window.

## vscpservice

** Version 1.0.0 of VSCP & Friends does not have the Windows service activated. We expect to have this program back in next version. **

When you install VSCP & Friends with the installation software both vscpservice and vscpd will be installed. If you want to run the service you just go to the control panel (//Control Panel/System and Security/Local Services//) and start it there. When it is installed it is set to be started manually and you can also change that at this location so the server is started when windows is started.

The service has a variable called start at

that should be set to 2 (autostart). It is set to 3 (manual) after installation so that you have the option to select which server/service to use.
This can also be done in the service applet (//Control Panel/System and Security/Local Services//).
